# Site Upload File

This repository contains a simple website for uploading files, developed by Melvin Malagowski and Bastien Passet. Users can upload files through a form, and the uploaded files are stored in the 'uploaded' directory.

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the file upload interface.

## Usage

1. Click on the "Afficher le formulaire" button to display the file upload form.

2. Fill in the required information, including Name, Surname, and choose a file to upload.

3. Click the "Upload" button to submit the form.

## File Upload Process

The PHP script (upload.php) handles the file upload process. Here's a brief overview:

- The uploaded files are stored in the 'uploaded' directory.

- The script verifies the file's extension and MIME type for security purposes.

- If the file meets the allowed criteria, it is renamed to include the user's name and surname.

- The file is then moved to the 'uploaded' directory.

- Upon successful upload, users are redirected to 'redirect.html'.

## Directory Structure

- **style**: Contains the CSS file for styling the website.

- **image**: Includes an example image used on the website.

- **php**: Contains the PHP script responsible for handling file uploads.

- **uploaded**: This directory will store the uploaded files.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the 'uploaded' directory has the necessary write permissions for the web server.

- Only files with extensions 'pdf', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', and 'gif' are allowed for upload.

- The PHP script performs security checks to prevent unauthorized file uploads.
